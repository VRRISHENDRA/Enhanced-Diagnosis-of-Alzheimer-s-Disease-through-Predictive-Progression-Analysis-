# Alzheimer's Disease Early Diagnosis Using CNN-LSTM and CNN-BiLSTM Frameworks
## Abstract
Alzheimer's disease is an insidious and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, yet its early-stage diagnosis remains challenging. Current diagnostic approaches based on neuroimaging or clinical evaluations detect the disease at advanced stages, leaving limited time for effective intervention. This project proposes a novel deep learning framework utilizing CNN-LSTM and CNN-BiLSTM models to enhance early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

### CNN: Extracts spatial information from medical image data.
### LSTM/BiLSTM: Captures temporal information, summarizing neurodegenerative changes.
The CNN-LSTM model effectively investigates both structural and sequential aspects of the disease. In contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model employs bidirectional learning to improve temporal pattern recognition. Both models operate independently and show promise in achieving higher diagnostic accuracy, enabling earlier detection and better treatment planning.

This research contributes to developing robust AI-based diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's disease, with the goal of improving patient outcomes through timely and accurate predictions.

## Introduction
### Alzheimer's Disease Overview
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. It is the leading cause of dementia among older adults and poses significant challenges as aging populations increase globally.

### The Need for Early Diagnosis
Early detection is crucial for slowing disease progression and improving patient quality of life. Current diagnostic methods—such as clinical assessments, neuroimaging, and biomarker analysis—often detect Alzheimer's in moderate or advanced stages. These approaches lack sensitivity for early-stage detection and are insufficient for optimal treatment planning.

### Role of Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Deep Learning, offers transformative potential in improving Alzheimer's diagnosis. With its ability to handle large datasets (e.g., medical images, clinical records, and genetic data), deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown effectiveness in neuroimaging analysis.

However, Alzheimer's disease involves temporal changes in brain structures, which demands models capable of analyzing both spatial and temporal features.

## Proposed Framework
This project proposes a dual deep learning framework:

### CNN-LSTM

Captures spatial features using CNN.
Leverages LSTM to analyze sequential neurodegenerative processes.
### CNN-BiLSTM

Captures spatial features using CNN.
Enhances temporal analysis using bidirectional learning (BiLSTM) for more robust pattern recognition.
## Key Advantages
Spatial Analysis: Leveraging CNN for high-resolution neuroimaging data.
Temporal Dynamics: Using LSTM/BiLSTM to detect time-based changes in brain structures.
Independent Models: Both frameworks provide reliable, interpretable results for early diagnosis.
## Objective
To develop an accurate, efficient AI-based diagnostic tool that improves early detection and intervention for Alzheimer's disease.

## Features
