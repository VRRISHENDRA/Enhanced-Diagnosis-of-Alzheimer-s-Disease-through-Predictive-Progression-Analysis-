Alzheimer's disease basically is an insidious and progressive neurodegenerative disorder; however, its early stage diagnosis cannot yet be accurate. The present diagnostic approaches used either on the basis of neuroimaging or clinical evaluation detect the disease at a rather late stage, opening only a small window for effective time-related intervention. In this paper, a new deep learning framework based on both CNN-LSTM as well as CNN-BiLSTM models shall be proposed for the enhanced early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. CNN was employed to obtain spatial information from the medical image data, and use of LSTMs and BiLSTMs captured temporal information while summarizing neurodegenerative change processes. CNN-LSTM has good performance by the investigation into both structural as well as sequential disease aspects, whereas CNN-BiLSTM makes use of a kind of bidirectional learning for time to achieve an efficient pattern recognition. Both the models run independently and provide valid results, hoping that the added accuracy will diagnose Alzheimer's much earlier, thus facilitating better design for treatments. This research contributes to the development of a more robust set of AI-based diagnostic tools designed to accurately predict and treat Alzheimer's disease in an attempt toward achieving the best outcomes for the patient.
